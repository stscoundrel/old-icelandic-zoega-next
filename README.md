## Motivation

There are various versions of different Old Norse dictionaries online. Many of these are either incomplete, or their usability has grown old. Most of them are either missing a search feature, or they may be a bit hefty to load in mobile.

I'm often reading Old Norse text outside in the park, but browsing back and forth to physical paper dictionary is something I've always found a bit slow. The original idea was to reduce the back-and-forth jumping by having dictionary open on my phone. Did not find any particular dictionary I was satisfied with, so I started working on this one, along with [Cleasby & Vigfusson version](https://github.com/stscoundrel/cleasby-vigfusson-next).

### About "A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic"

Zoëgas attempt was to made easier-to-approach version of the more full *Cleasby - Vigfusson dictionary*, specifically for beginners and those interested in Old Icelandic prose writing.
